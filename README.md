## 📖 Summary

This repository contains materials, exercises, and projects from the course "Introduction to Relational Databases (RDBMS)" offered by IBM through Coursera as part of the IBM Data Engineer Professional Certificate specialization.

The course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts of relational databases and relational database management systems (RDBMS). Students learn how to design data models, create databases, write SQL queries, and understand the principles of normalization and data integrity.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this course is to equip students with foundational knowledge of relational databases, enabling them to:

- Understand the basic concepts of relational databases

- Design efficient data models using normalization

- Create and manipulate databases using SQL

- Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

- Work with aggregate functions and SQL joins

- Develop practical skills with popular RDBMS systems
